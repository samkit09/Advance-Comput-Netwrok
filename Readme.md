# ACN_Project - Creator: Samkit Saraf

CS 6390 Fall 2022 Programming Project

Excecuted the program on sxs220101@net09.utdallas.edu

This project is built on Python3.6

## Steps to execute ->

1. Write topology in '''topology.txt''' in following format - "node_id1 node_id2" and pllace it along other files in the same directory.
   Example -
   0 1
   1 2
   2 3
   Do this before running rest of the program. If incorrect format is enterred error will be raised.

_Note_ - Keep single space between node ids and each pair in separate line.

2. Run the corresponding scenario.sh file while being the directory of the project folder.
   '''bash
   ./scenario1.sh
   '''

3. Folder with name '''files''' will be created and all the input*.txt, output*.txt and n_received.txt file will be created and saved inside this folder.

These files will be automatically cleaned when you run any of the scenario.sh file again!
So you do not have to delete them manually.

_Note_ - _Be sure to check_ the output before you run other scenario file as it will be _earsed_.

Thank you.
