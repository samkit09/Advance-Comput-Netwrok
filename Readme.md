# ACN_Project - Creator: Samkit Saraf

CS 6390 Fall 2022 Programming Project

Excecuted the program on sxs220101@net09.utdallas.edu

This project is built on Python3.6

## Steps to execute ->

1. Write topology in '''topology.txt''' in following format - "node_id1 node_id2" and place it along other files in the same directory.
   Example - <br>
   0 1<br>
   1 2<br>
   2 3<br>
   Do this before running rest of the program. If incorrect format is enterred error will be raised.

_Note_ - Keep single space between node ids and each pair in separate line.

2. Run the corresponding scenario.sh file while being in the directory of the project folder.<br>
   `./scenario1.sh`

3. Folder with name `files` will be created and all the `input_*.txt, output_*.txt and *_received.txt` file will be created and saved inside this folder.

These files will be automatically cleaned/reset when you run any of the scenario.sh file again!
So you do not have to delete them manually.

_Note_ - _Be sure to check_ the output before you run other `scenario.sh` file as it will be _earsed_.

Thank you.
